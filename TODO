# Developing Blocks
* all common components placed in a copy_comp.sch which is used by the
  the designer to help ensure consistency, ease of BoM management
* all new blocks to be developed on master branch and placed into the
  copy_block.sch
  ** then, project branches will pull in the changes from master branch
     *** this way, we do not have each branch going off on their own, and then
         we have to manually figure out which ones should go to master

# Master Branch (sym, sch, fp)
* any changes to these repos will now be done in master branch and pulled into
  the project branch
* set up a KiCad project environment for sch, fp, sym
* having each project track their own individual sch, sym, and fp branches
  rather than the master branch will prevent 'downs' from incidentally
  updating the fp or sym when you dont want it to. you'll have to manually do
  this
  ** this requires an additional step to pull changes from master when you
     make a new fp or symbol, but i think this outweighs the cost of having
     the sch repo be out of date and a mess to update

# TODOs for every project
* create TODO template
* check off [] in TODOs with initial
* commit message can simply be 'todo'

# Local Names to Help Assigning Net Classes
* in each block, use a local net name on each net so that it is easy to
  identify which class it belongs to.
  ** this is important in autorouting
